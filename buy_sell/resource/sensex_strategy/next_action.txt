===================================
So, now I have a database of all the sensex scripts, daily for 10 years. It's a gold mine.

Here are some thoughts about how I can start breaking it down.

1. This all data will go in the DB.
2. Daily I should be able to find what is 52 week low, 52 week high etc with a DB query.
3. Now I start with a stragegy from 1 April 2013.
4. I have my portfolio
    Portfolio is a list of scripts. Each bought at different valuation at different time
    If Stock is 52 week low, I put an intention to buy (provided I don't have this script already bought within 1 year)
    When Stock rises by X% (1%) from 52 week low, I execute a buy. I buy 1000 rupee worth of stock. Fractions is fine.
    This will get added to my portfolio.

    I keep doing buying

    Also, I look for 52 week max - and make a sale if I have the stock when it falls below by 1% of 52 week peak (provided script is at least 1 year old).

    Thus I will buy and sell.

    At any state my portfolio summary is:

    I have total invested amount = 10K
    Total profit booked = 3.5K
    Total amount held in stocks 8.5K

    More detailed portfoloio is all my sale transactions
    Average Sale IRR:
    Average IRR of stocks held.

    And of course, individual sale IRR and invididual Stock IRR.


   Principle is keep booking profit and move the money into experiential world.
   For investing borry money.

Technology
1. Core JAVA
2. Object Orientation
3. MySQL for database

Run the program once for entire range (maybe overnight) and get a feel.
and it may result in lukewarm 6% IRR - then we know.
But if it's like 60%, then we know that I need to leave the job.

Commandline program
 
- Configure
- Execute
- Report
- Reset

Execute should give prompt - 13 out of 130 - buy 12 sale 9

Let's load to DB first
